This is a project for detection of smoking from the given images. The codes are based on implementation of Yolo V8
 The model generates bounding boxes for each instance of an object ( cigeratte) in the image.

Dataset-
The Dataset for this task was obtained from Kaggle, as this particular problem largely involves privacy matters and concerns. 
While the goal was to obtain data from real world scenarios, the dataset provides representation close to that of actual samples, with the object of target, 
a cigarette appearing at many different scales and sizes. Here's the datset link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/smoking.

Labelling of these images was done using Label studio where i used bounding boxes to bound the area of cigratte and for training the model.
I split the images in 80% training images and 20% validation images.
Training parameters included:

Epochs: set to the required number for convergence.

Image size: resized to 640Ã—640 pixels for input.

Batch size: defined for efficient GPU usage.

Results-
The model successfully detected cigeratte regions with high accuracy.

Generated graphs (training curves, confusion matrix, and precision-recall curves) demonstrated strong model performance.
