Task 4 - Overview-
Creating and training a custom object detection model using YOLOv8.
The dataset I chose was from Roboflow - A dataset of Candy Images.
The objects were categorized into 11 classes- Airheads, Milkyway, Snickers, Twizzlers, Skittles, MnM regular, MnM peanut, Nerds, gummy worms, 3 mushkeeters, starbust.
I used Label Studio to annotate and label the images using boundary boxes.( I have also uploaded a video showcasing labelling being done)
Exported the labeled dataset in YOLOv8 format from Label Studio.
Divided the dataset into two subsets: 80 percent for training and 20 percent for validation.
Created the required folder structure with separate directories for training and validation images and labels.
Configured the data.yaml file with class names and paths to the training and validation sets.
Initiated model training using the YOLOv8 model with 50 epochs and an image size of 640.
Monitored training progress and validated the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as mAP and precision.
My task was completed successfully after my model was able to predict and name each of the candy of the testing dataset.
